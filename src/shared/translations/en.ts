      paragraph1:
        'Vextro® is not born from a business plan. It is born from dissatisfaction with a marketing market focused on selling itself, not its clients. With the mission of challenging mediocrity and the comfort zone, its visual identity project was conceived to be the materialization of this revolt.',
      paragraph2:
        'The central challenge was to translate values like "disruption" and "restlessness" into a cohesive and functional visual system. Vextro® needed an identity that would not only differentiate it, but would function as a declaration of war against generic, predictable, and soulless marketing.',
      paragraph3:
        'At the center of this identity is a logo that is, in itself, a manifesto. Its modular and deconstructed structure, with an inverted italic, represents a deliberate movement against the current. It is not just a stylized typography; it is the visual representation of our philosophy of breaking the pattern to find growth.',
      paragraph4:
        "The visual system is built on strategic decisions, not aesthetic ones. The color palette is led by blue, chosen as the color of rivalry, in direct opposition to major market players. Black acts as an amplifier, giving weight and authority to the message. The main typography was selected for its ability to create tension, combining stable characters with disruptive alternatives that echo the logo's identity.",
      paragraph5:
        'Each supporting element was extracted from the DNA of the logo itself. The graphic supports are deconstructed fragments of the letters, used to command the layout with the same breaking energy of the brand. The photographic style reinforces this vision, capturing "restlessness" through dark environments, blue lighting and intentional motion blur.',
      paragraph6:
        'This visual identity is not just a set of rules and elements. It is the operating system of a brand built to be a force of provocation. In every detail, Vextro® communicates its purpose: reject the "good" to seek the extraordinary.'

        'The symbol represents a "breath" of relief after an intense day — a moment to breathe. With a vibrant yellow tone, it expresses Brazil\'s pulsating energy. Korri®\'s entire visual universe was designed to connect with peripheral youth, translating identity, attitude, and originality into its own aesthetic.',
      paragraph3:
        'The name derives from the Brazilian slang "corre," widely used by young people as an expression for work. It also has a double meaning related to the activity of "running," referring to sports practice.'
